### Hi!

I'm Kelvin, a second-year Computer Science student at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/). At UCI, I've excelled in academic coursework, earning straight A's in courses such as operating systems and databases, and explored applying software solutions to radiology research at the [Molloi Lab of Imaging Physics](https://sites.uci.edu/molloilabimagingphysics/). Currently, I'm interested in delving deep into backend development and finding exciting growth opportunities in software engineering internships and operating systems/distributed computing research.

Currently, I'm working on a kahoot-styled web platform for interactive computer science learning.

Some cool projects I've previously worked on:
- [üåê WebLite](https://github.com/zhaoKelvin/WebLite): a web browser and engine built from scratch capable of visiting any website on the web and rendering them too! (well, at least rivaling early Internet Explorerüß≠)
- [üßπ Yakamoto Clean Sweep](https://maidandready.itch.io/yakamoto-clean-sweep) [[Github](https://github.com/Reallife101/YakamotoCleanSweep)]: an FPC (First Person Cleaner) about creating spotless perfection with pinpoint accuracy and speed! Featuring buttery smooth movement physics and gameplay mechanics.
